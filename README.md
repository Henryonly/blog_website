# My Personal Blog

Hello,this is my personal blog!😃😃😃This blog acts as an experience of front-end,back-end,operations and design,which has deepened my understanding of web development and computer network.

When you reach the first page,you will be amazed by the brilliance of its amazing UI design,which is mostly supported by Tailwind.Comments are supported and hack preventions are taken into account,such as flood attack.🤯

As for the back-end,I have used toolkits such as docker and nginx.They are meaningful for security and robustness of this website.👌

Just another thing:If you have found a 0day bug,I beg you point it out and I wish this website to be better with our efforts.🐱
